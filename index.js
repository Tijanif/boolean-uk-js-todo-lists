Hey everyone! Today we have another head scratcher for you to solve! This will take everything you've learned so far to solve it, plus it will be a great practice for your problem solving skills!

As usual, grab a break before start tacking this, and most importantly, have fun!! :tada:

Today's exercise: Todo Lists

Repo: boolean-uk-js-todo-lists

Description
This is the first try at a common program built by new developers, the todo list. You'll have to use everything we've covered so far in JS to tackle this challenge

Instructions
- Use this starting template, you'll find two objects with data for you to use => https://codesandbox.io/s/todo-lists-tr122?from-embed=&file=/index.js
- Do not code your solution in CodeSandbox
- Create an alert that lists all users, with their ids, names and what city they're from
- Prompt the user for a user id
- Display an alert with the username and all the todos titles that belong to that user 

Tips
- The user id creates an identifiable relationship with the todos
- Sometimes it's good to map some values into a new data structure

Challenge
After you select a user, add the option to either show the todos or add a new todo to the list

Challenge 2
Now that you can add a todo, add the option to either delete or update a todo. Add also the option to repeatedly choose a different user, or to finish the program

// ${user.address.city}
// `)

// Prompt the user for a user id
// Display an alert with the username and all the todos titles that belong to that user
